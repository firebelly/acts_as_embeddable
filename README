ActsAsEmbeddable
================

Currently this plugin only handles youtube videos, but I intend to add support for more embeddable media. It's untested
and I wouldn't really recommend using it yet, but I will be working on it.

Inspiration was pretty much taken from the XHTML embed plugin for wordpress: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xhtml-video-embed/


Example
=======

in your model:

acts_as_embeddable :content

Users can then enter something like this into the CMS:
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQbuyKUaKFo[/youtube]
or
[youtube]PQbuyKUaKFo[/youtube]
or
[youtube width="150" height="100"]PQbuyKUaKFo[/youtube]
